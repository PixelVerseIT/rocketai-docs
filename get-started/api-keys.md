# API Keys

Since RocketAI is using the Google PaLM2 API, you will need to generate an API key. Generating an API key is free. Register an account at [makersuite.google.com](https://makersuite.google.com/) and follow the instructions below:

### Getting an API key from Google MakerSuite

1. Register using your Google Account for a MakerSuite account at: [https://makersuite.google.com/](https://makersuite.google.com/)
2. On the right-hand side, click on the "key" icon![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

4. Your API key will be generated. Keep your API key in a safe place on your computer. Do not share your API key with anyone. You will need it to use RocketAI.
