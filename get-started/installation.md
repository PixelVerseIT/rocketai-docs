# Installation

RocketAI is based on Python and is built for Python. If you do not have Python installed, you can install it by going to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### One line installation

To have RocketAI installed, run the following Python PIP command.&#x20;

```python
pip install RocketAI
```

{% hint style="info" %}
When you run the command, it will also install google.generative library if you haven't already got it installed because it is required to run RocketAI.
{% endhint %}

Once the command is finished running, check if there are any issues or errors. If there are, try reinstalling by running the following commands:

```python
# Uninstall RocketAI
pip uninstall RocketAI
```

and installing it again:

```
# Install RocketAI
pip install RocketAI
```
